# AMETHST Installation
########################################################################### 
# Amethst can be installed in two different ways, outlined below. 
# This directory contains one installation script for each method.
# Both installations require Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Installation may work 
# on other Ubuntu and linux-based systems, but has only been tested 
# on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
#
# (1) Installation as a stand alone tool:

sudo Install_local_AMETHST.sh

# NOTES: This installation will allow you to use the perl version of
# the driving AMETHST script (AMETHST.pl) to perform AMETHST analyses
# on a single computer or environment. We recommend using a computer/
# environment with multiple CPUs. Execution of AMETHST with a small 
# number of CPUs and a large number of permutations is possible, but can
# take a considerable amount of time. The installer will run the test 
# script /AMETHST/test_amethst.sh; if this script runs without errors,
# your installation of AMETHST should be complete. The installer will
# clone this repository, and add it to your path.
#
#
# (2) Installation as a backend compute node for the KBase AMETHST service:
# Note: this installation is intended for KBase admins.
 
sudo -E Install_AMETHST_compute_node.havannah.sh

# NOTES: This installation will prepare a VM to run as a backend compute
# node for the KBase AMETHST service. Installation requires an envrionment
# populated with valid KB_AUTH_TOKEN and AWE_CLIENT_GROUP_TOKEN variables.
# Please refer to kbase.us to 
#  - create a KBase account
#  - obtain appropriate credentials
#  - start a KBase VM
#  - install and run the AMETHST service
