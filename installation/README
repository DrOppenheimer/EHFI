# AMETHST Installation
###########################################################################
# Amethst can be installed in two different ways, outlined below. 
# This directory contains one installation script for each method.
# Both installations require Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Installation may work 
# on other Ubuntu and linux-based systems, but has only been tested 
# on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
#
# (1) Installation as a stand alone tool:

sudo Install_local_AMETHST.sh

# NOTES: This installation will allow you to use the perl version of
# the driving AMETHST script (AMETHST.pl) to perform AMETHST analyses
# on a single computer or environment. We recommend using a computer/
# environment with multiple CPUs. Execution of AMETHST with a small 
# number of CPUs and a large number of permutations is possible, but can
# take a considerable amount of time.
#
#
#
# (2) Installation as a backend compute node for the KBase AMETHST service:
 
sudo -E Install_AMETHST_compute_node.havannah.sh

# NOTES: This installation will prepare a VM to run as a backend compute
# node for the KBase AMETHST service. Installation requires an envrionment
# populated with valid KB_AUTH_TOKEN and AWE_CLIENT_GROUP_TOKEN variables.
