# AMETHST (Analysis METHod Selection Tool)
#
# Brief Description
#      AMETHST is an anlysis that provides a hypothesis driven means to objectively assess
# the relative performance of multiple analysis methods applied to annotation abundance 
# data.  AMETHST always requires Ubuntu (currently it has only been tested on 14.04 LTS),
# bu can be used as a stand alone tool on a local computer/envrionment or can be used as
# a service in KBase. See the "installation" directory in this repository for installation
# intructions. 
#      AMETHST utilizes permutation (monte-carlo) based statistics to
# perform two seperate tests. For each analysis that AMETHST is used to assess, three
# inputs are expected, an annotation abundance matrix (columns are samples, rows are 
# functions or taxa), a file that indicates sample groupings (a comma separated string indicating
# the groupings by column in the abundance matrix - e.g. a,b,b,a would place the first and
# last column in one group, the second and third in another), and a number of options
# that define exactly how the anlaysis will be performed. 
#     The AMETHST testing procedure has two stages, the first examines how well each
# analysis method is able to recognize members of biological groups (specified by the input
# sample groupings). This test provides a fairly stringent means to identify poor performing
# analysis methods - defined as those methods that cannot distinguish groupings in the real,
# original data, from random permutations of it. The second stage analysis provides a means
# to assess the signficance with which differences between biological groups are detected.
