AMETHST, or Analysis METHod Selection Tool, is an automated pipeline that makes it possible to objectively assess the relative performance of multiple analysis methods applied to annotation abundance data. Utilizing objective, permutation-based statistics, it can determine the best performing analysis from any arbitrary collection of analyses, and can also determine the degree to which each analysis step (e.g. normalization and reprocessing of the data, selection of distance/dissimilarity metric) affects the results produced by each analysis method.

The "Installation" directory contains instructions and a simple to use script to install AMETHST on Ubuntu (tested on 12.04 and 14.04 LTS)

The "using_amethst" directory contains instructions for running amethst, on test datasets included in this repository and on any other data that you wish to analyze with AMETHST. Instructions include a "quick guide" and a much more detailed description of running AMETHST
