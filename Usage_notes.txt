AMETHST has a number of built in fucntionalities that can be used to preprocess input data (e.g. removal of singleton counts, normalization and standardization of counts in each sample). However, we have found that the easiest way to use AMETHST is, generally, to forgo this functionality, supplying one abundance profile for each combination of preprocessing procedures.  This makes it possible to conduct an AMETHST analysis on data produced by preprocessing methods that AMETHST itself does not currently support (e.g. normalization with a tool like DESeq*). It is still necessarry to use AMETHST itself to perform all operations other than preprocessing. This method of using AMETHST greatly simplifies the input parameters:
